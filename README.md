# Inventory Management App (Demo-Day Project)

### Goal: Allow users to login to their account to view, manage, and store their eBay inventory and sales/accounting metrics.

## Dashboard page shows users a quick preview of their monthly metrics. Inventory page allows users to view metrics regarding sales, while also allowing users to edit some of the data within the tables. Accounting page shows users thier gross/net profit, and fees incured for a period of time. The web application will be connected using an eBay api, to help autopopulate the user's inventory/accounting metrics.
